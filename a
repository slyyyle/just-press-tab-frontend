smokin sippin lemonade or sippin smokin sedidate
i need to set it straight thats mexico to meditate

texaco for wraps I medicate a world thats sellin hate
can't tell at 8 when they get tired 
day old inspired
boy thats cellophane

i woulda hit the jug if yall werent meddlin
bikin on the ocean to be frank, 
floating, peddling
don't need amphetamine

God made boy for better things
me and life go seprate ways
then boy and I will settle things

dont need attention, cancer to me like hesphestous
bitch why you stressin, no one ever watched no credits
life aint election, or id eat my smith and wesson
cause carbs they just the devil, starvins something of a blessin
