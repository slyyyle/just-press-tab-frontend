              My name is Kyle Hammitt, and I am an AI Software Engineer. 
              I created this website to showcase AI rather than just tell you about it.

            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Three weeks ago, I knew nothing about front-end development, yet here we are. This site exists because I
              embraced AI as a collaborative tool rather than trying to master everything myself.

              I didn't meticulously handcraft this websiteâ€”instead, I guided an algorithm through hundreds of prompts to
              teach me, refactor code, explain types, and demonstrate best practices. Technically I wrote it in the sense 
              people want to point to for merit.  It was a great teacher - I knew there would be bumps.
              
              These AI tools may be uninterpretable under the hood, but that's their strength.  We still have to coach in some capacity.

              By relaxing our need for specific things to work - we make our models harder to understand, but more
              capable of doing difficult things.  For now, that is the trade off - we are replacing explanatory power for utility.{" "}
